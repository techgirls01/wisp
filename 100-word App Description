The American Lung Association reports that film smoking scenes increase the risk of teen smoking almost three-fold. Celebrity smokers and cigarette product placement are types of subliminal messaging used by tobacco companies to target kids, potential long-term customers.

Our Android application, Wisp, works to make the public aware of smoking in films. Wisp is an interactive community where users can contribute comments and ratings based on a movieâ€™s smoking content.  These user reviews enable caregivers to make informed decisions about the movies they show kids. Additionally, Wisp is an invaluable and comprehensive public opinion resource for anti-smoking advocates and policymakers.
